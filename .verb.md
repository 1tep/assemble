Welcome to Assemble! We're happy to announce the release of Assemble v{%= version %}! If you're new to assemble, the [About](#about) section and [FAQ](#faq) might be a good place to start. 

## Developer toolkit

Assemble can be used standalone, or alongside the following libraries as part of a build workflow:

- [generate][]: create projects
- [assemble][]: build projects (<= you are here)
- [verb][]: document projects
- [update][]: maintain projects

_(All of these applications are built on [base][].)_

## What is Assemble?

Assemble makes it easy to create, customize, generate and maintain complete web projects. Here are some highlights:

* **Render templates** using any template engine, including [handlebars][], [lodash][], [swig][] and [pug][], and anything supported by [consolidate][].
* **Engine detection**: If you register multiple engines, Assemble will automatically detect the correct one to use on each template at render time.
* **gulp plugins**: Full support for [gulp][] plugins. Read our [gulp FAQ](docs/src/subjects/gulp-faq.md) for more info about gulp support.
* **Collections**: First class collection support, with paging, pagination, lists (arrays), groups and sorting. Collections even support plugins and collection-specific routes.
* **Markdown**: Transform content from markdown or any other plain text format to HTML using plugins, middleware helpers or engines.
* **Easy to extend**: Extremely pluggable and easy to extend with helpers, plugins, routes, middleware or engines. 
* **Data**: Use any data source for rendering templates, making it easy to begin a project using mock data and switch "live" data source later on.

### Why assemble?

**Why should I use assemble, instead of X?**

* Powerful flow control using [gulp][]-style [tasks](docs/tasks.md)
* Use [middleware](docs/middleware.md) at any point in the [render cycle](docs/render-cycle.md)
* Granular [control over context](docs/why-assemble#context)
* [Plugin ecosystem](docs/why-assemble#plugin-ecosystem): Use any [gulp][] plugin, or plugins from any [base][] application
* Facilitates the use of _modular, encapsulated components_ in your markup, like pages, partials and layouts, resulting in consistent design across your projects.
* Built using [base][]. By learning how to use assemble, you'll also learn how to work with [verb][], [generate][], [update][] and other [base][] apps.
* Functional, expressive API 
* Intuitive CLI, with commands that map elegantly to API methods and conventions

### What can I do with assemble?

Use assemble to create:

* [blogs](examples/blog)
* [build system](examples/build-tool)
* documentation
* e-books
* front-end UI
* [generate boilerplates](examples/boilerplates)
* [generate targets](examples/targets)
* landing pages
* [project generator](examples/generator)
* [project scaffolds](examples/scaffold)
* rapid prototyping
* static site generator
* styleguides
* themes

### Additional features

* templates are [vinyl][] files
* rich plugin support, use any [gulp][] or [base][] plugin!
* render templates with any [template engine](#engine), including [nunjucks][engine-nunjucks], [handlebars][engine-handlebars], [lodash][engine-lodash] and any consolidate engine!
* [helpers](#helpers): support for sync and async
* [templates collections](#collections) support
* partials and includes
* layouts
* pages
* custom template "types"
* pagination
* [permalinks][assemble-permalinks]
* [middleware](#middleware) can be used to tranform files at any stage in the render cycle
* pagination
* Much more!

## Getting started

### Installing assemble

To use assemble's CLI, you will first need to install it globally using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```sh
$ npm --global install assemble
```

This adds the `assemble` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.


### Example usage

#### Rendering templates

Render a template with with [handlebars][]:

```js
var assemble = require('{%= name %}');
var app = assemble();
var locals = {title: 'Home!'};

// add a "page" 
app.page('home.hbs', {content: 'This is {{title}}'});

// render it!
app.render('home.hbs', locals, function(err, view) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(view.content);
  //=> 'This is Home!'
});
```

#### Running tasks

Create an `assemblefile.js` and add tasks to run:

```js
var assemble = require('assemble');
var htmlmin = require('gulp-htmlmin');
var app = assemble();

app.page('a.hbs', {content: '...'});
app.page('b.hbs', {content: '...'});
app.page('c.hbs', {content: '...'});

app.task('default', function() {
   return app.toStream('pages')
    .pipe(app.renderFile())
    .pipe(htmlmin())
    .pipe(app.dest('site'));
});

// expose your instance of assemble
module.exports = app;
```

## CLI

Run assemble from the command line.

```sh
$ assemble <tasks> [options]
```

### Tasks

Specify one or more tasks to run.

**Examples**

Run task `foo`

```sh
$ assemble foo
```

Run tasks `foo` and `bar`

```sh
$ assemble foo bar
```

### Options

Non-task options are prefixed with `--`.

**Example**

Set the `--cwd` to run an assemblefile.js in a different directory:

```sh
$ assemble foo bar
# or 
$ assemble --cwd examples
```

**Example**

To emit views as they're loaded and log them to `stderr`, run assemble with the following command:

```sh
$ assemble --emit view
# or
$ assemble --emit=view
```

### Object expansion

Object-paths may be specified using dot-notation for **either the key or value** in a command line argument.

Additionally, assemble uses [expand-object][] (and some custom parsing) to make it easier to pass non-trivial options and commands via command line. So all of the following formats are possible.

**Examples**

Boolean values:

```sh
$ assemble --foo 
# { foo: true }
```

Key-value pairs:

```sh
$ assemble --foo=bar
# { foo: 'bar' }
```

Nested booleans:

```sh
$ assemble --option=foo 
# {options: { foo: true }}
```

Nested key-value pairs:

```sh
$ assemble --option=foo:bar
# {options: { foo: 'bar' }}
```

Deeply nested key-value pairs:

```sh
$ assemble --option=foo.bar.baz:qux
# {options: foo: { bar: { baz: 'qux' }}}}
```

Or on the left-side of the `=`:

```sh
$ assemble --option.foo.bar.baz=qux
# {options: foo: { bar: { baz: 'qux' }}}}
```

### cwd

Change the `cwd` for the `assemblefile.js` to run, optionally specifying any tasks to run:

```sh
$ assemble <tasks> --cwd [directory]
```

**Example**

To run the `scaffolds` example in the `examples/` directory, you would enter:

```sh
$ assemble --cwd examples/scaffolds
```

If successful, in the command line, you should see something like this:

### file

The name of which file to load when running, defaulting to `assemblefile.js`:

```sh
$ assemble --file assemblefile.dev.js
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Templates API

Assemble has an extensive API for working with templates and template collections. In fact, the entire API from the [templates][] library is available on Assemble. 

While we work on getting the assemble docs updated with these methods you can visit [the templates library][templates] to learn more about the full range of features and options. 

## Render cycle

## File System API

Assemble offers the following low-level methods for working with the file system:

- [src](#src)
- [symlink](#symlink)
- [dest](#dest)
- [copy](#copy)

Assemble has first-class support for [vinyl-fs][], so any [gulp][] plugin can be used in your assemble pipeline.

### .src

Create a [vinyl][] stream. Takes glob patterns or filepaths to the source files to read.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Glob patterns or file paths to source files.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options or locals to merge into the context and/or pass to `src` plugins

**Example**

```js
app.src('src/*.hbs');

// define `src` options
app.src('src/*.hbs', { layout: 'default' });
```

### .dest

Specify a destination for processed files.

**Params**

* `dest` **{String|Function}**: File path or rename function.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options and locals to pass to `dest` plugins

**Example**

```js
app.dest('dist/');
```

### .copy

Copy files with the given glob `patterns` to the specified `dest`.

**Params**

* `patterns` **{String|Array}**: Glob patterns of files to copy.
* `dest` **{String|Function}**: Desination directory.
* `returns` **{Stream}**: Stream, to continue processing if necessary.

**Example**

```js
app.task('assets', function() {
  // return, to let assemble know when the task has completed
  return app.copy('assets/**', 'dist/');
});
```

### .symlink

Same as `.src` but takes glob patterns or filepaths for the symlinks to read.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Glob patterns or file paths 

**Example**

```js
app.symlink('src/*.hbs');
```

***

## Task API

Assemble has the following methods for running tasks and controlling workflows:

- [task](#task)  
- [build](#build)  
- [watch](#watch)  

### .task

Define a task to be run when the task is called.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Task name
* `fn` **{Function}**: function that is called when the task is run.

**Example**

```js
app.task('default', function() {
  app.src('templates/*.hbs')
    .pipe(app.dest('site/'));
});
```

### .build

Run one or more tasks.

**Params**

* `tasks` **{Array|String}**: Task name or array of task names.
* `cb` **{Function}**: callback function that exposes `err`

**Example**

```js
app.build(['foo', 'bar'], function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('done!');
});
```

### .watch

Watch files, run one or more tasks when a watched file changes.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Filepaths or glob patterns.
* `tasks` **{Array}**: Task(s) to watch.

**Example**

```js
app.task('watch', function() {
  app.watch('docs/*.md', ['docs']);
});
```

## Plugins

### Discovering plugins

Plugins from any applications built on [base][] should work with Assemble and can be used in your `assemblefile.js`:

* [base][base-plugin]: find base plugins on npm using the `baseplugin` keyword
* [assemble][assemble-plugin]: find assemble plugins on npm using the `assembleplugin` keyword
* [generate][generate-plugin]: find generate plugins on npm using the `generateplugin` keyword
* [templates][templates-plugin]: find templates plugins on npm using the `templatesplugin` keyword
* [update][update-plugin]: find update plugins on npm using the `updateplugin` keyword

### FAQ

**Website is outdated and being refactored!**

Assemble's website, assemble.io, only has information related to [gulp-assemble][]. We're working hard to update the site with information about the latest release. 

In the meantime, you might find the [WIP docs](docs/src/content) useful. The [unit tests](test/) are also great examples! 

**Is the assemble website up-to-date?**

No, as mentioned above, it's completely out-of-date. If you're using [grunt-assemble][], some of the documentation at assemble.io might still be useful. If you're using assemble v0.6.0 and higher, the documentation is probably wrong in almost every way. 

We're actively (daily) working on a refactor and it's a very high priority. 

**What's the difference between [assemble-core][] and assemble?**

Assemble adds a CLI, a few built-in view collections: `pages`, `layouts`, and `partials`, middleware for parsing front-matter, and a few other basic defaults that we've found many users expect. If you'd prefer different defaults, [assemble-core][] is a great starting point. 

If you want something that handles templates, rendering, engines, helpers, collections, etc. but you don't need to run tasks or work with the file system, then consider using [templates][] instead of assemble-core.

**I use gulp, why is it recommended to use assemble directly, instead of running assemble with gulp?**

You can run gulp plugins with assemble, but it won't always work the other way around. This is because, as a build system, assemble does things that gulp doesn't do, like handle middleware. 

For example, assemble's `.src` and `.dest` methods have built-in `.onStream`, `.preWrite`, and `.postWrite` middleware handlers. If you still wish to use gulp and your build cycle includes middleware that requires these handlers, you can use the [assemble-handle][] plugin with gulp to ensure that the handlers are still called as needed.

This is a long way of saying, you can find ways to make gulp work, but you would just be adding an extra dependency to your project to do things that assemble already does.

**What is the relationship between gulp and assemble?**

Please read our [gulp FAQ](docs/src/subjects/gulp-faq.md) for more information.

## What is Assemble?
### It's awesome.

Assemble is a node.js/JavaScript utility that automatically builds projects and libraries from source code by reading a file named `assemblefile.js`, which defines how to generate the expected result. 

Besides building projects, Assemble can be used to update any project that contains files that must be updated automatically whenever other files change.

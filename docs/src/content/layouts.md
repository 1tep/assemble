# Layouts

> Layouts are views (templates) that can wrap other views with common content or code.

## Facts

- Layouts are a special kind of view that belong to the `layouts` view collection
- Layouts are stored on the `assemble.views.layouts` object.

In Assemble, any view (template) can be wrapped with a layout. Pages, partials, posts, or even other layouts.

Since a view may have a layout, and that view's layout may have another layout defined, and so on - ad infinitum - we refer to a view's layout

# Middleware FAQ

> Methods for defining and using middleware and routes

**What is "middleware"?**

Middleware functions are functions that have access to:

- The `view` object (in {{name}}, a "view" is an instance of a [vinyl][] file), and 
- A callback function, `next`, which represents the next middleware in the applicationâ€™s build cycle

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the `view` object.
- Call the `next` middleware function in the stack.

**What is a "handler"?**

Middleware functions must be invoked by a middleware handler, which themselves are invoked at pre-determined points during runtime. 

Handlers are assigned method names, like `.onLoad` and `preRender`, each of which is typically associated with a specific middleware method known as a "verb" that will only be invoked by that handler.

For example, the `.onLoad()` method is invoked by the `onLoad` handler when templates are loaded, and the `.preRender()` method is invoked by the `preRender` handler before templates are passed to the engine for rendering.

**What does the handler do?**

When a handler is invoked

**What is a middleware stack?**

A middleware stack is an array of middleware functions that are invoked by the Assemble routing layer, and sits in the middle between view creation and writing to the file system. We refer to these functions as the middleware stack since they are always invoked in the order they are added.

- Each file that passes through the [pipeline](./api-task.md#pipeline.md) has its own middleware stack, which may have zero or more middleware functions
- Middleware functions are always invoked in the order in which they are defined.

**Verbs**

> verbs determine **when to run**

- Special middleware methods known as "verbs" determine **when** middleware functions are run
- Each verb is invoked by a middleware _handler_ that is configured to run that specific verb, at a specic point during runtime. For example, the `onLoad` handler invokes all `.onLoad()` middleware when a template is loaded.

**Routes**

Given that "verbs" determine **when** a middleware function is called, "routes" determine which files to process. 

**Routes**

> routes determine **which files to operate on**

- Routes are used to selectively match **which** files to operate on.

## Related topics

While plugins and middleware are both used to "extend" {{name}}, they serve very different purposes, are used in completely different ways, and have access to different objects at runtime.

## Install assemble

**CLI**

If you plan to use assemble from the command line using the `assemble` command, you'll need to install assemble globally:

```sh
$ npm install assemble -g
```

**API**

If you want to use assemble's API, as just another node.js library in your project:

```sh
# tip: instead of `--save-dev` you can do `-D`
$ npm install assemble --save-dev
```

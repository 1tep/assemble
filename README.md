# [Assemble](http://assemble.io)

> Get the rocks out of your socks.


First and foremost, this project just launched in early 2013 so expect frequent changes. If you find this project interesting, please consider watching or starring it to show your support.


**A balance of best practices, convention and configuration**

Assemble helps you _quickly launch web projects_ using HTML and CSS components, scaffolds, client-side templates, mock-data, CSS pre-processors, markdown, YAML, JSON, sensible configuration defaults and a Grunt.js build system to make it work while you're sleeping - on the job or off, that's up to you.

This project was designed to be more about flexibility and speed, and less about opinion and prescription. So we'll give you some examples, and show you _how to speed up your projects_, but we won't force you to do it our way.



## Quick start

  * Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/sellside/assemble.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/sellside/assemble/zipball/master).
  * Use one of Assemble's boilerplates to get up and running
  * See some [working example's] of projects using Assemble
  * Read the [wiki](https://github.com/sellside/assemble/wiki)

Once you get up and running, be sure to checkout [Toolkit](http://toolkit.io) for a library of UI components and project scaffolds that are designed to work with Assemble.

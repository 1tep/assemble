# [Assemble](http://assemble.io)

> Get the rocks out of your socks.


First and foremost, this project is just launching as of early 2013, so expect frequent changes and please consider contributing.


Assemble helps you _quickly launch web projects_ using HTML and CSS components, scaffolds, client-side templates, mock-data, CSS pre-processors, markdown, YAML, JSON, sensible configuration defaults and a Grunt.js build system to make it work while you're sleeping - on the job or off, that's up to you.


**A system is not a strategy**

This project was designed to be more about flexibility and speed, and less about opinion and prescription.

So we'll give you some examples, and show you how to speed up your projects, but we won't force you to do it our way. And if you like what we're doing but you prefer using different technologies than what we offer, we encourage you to add one as a plugin and submit a pull request.



## Quick start

  * Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/sellside/assemble.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/sellside/assemble/zipball/master).
  * Use one of Assemble's boilerplates to get up and running
  * See some [working example's] of projects using Assemble
  * Read the [wiki](https://github.com/sellside/assemble/wiki)

Once you get up and running, be sure to checkout [Toolkit](http://toolkit.io) for a library of UI components and project scaffolds that are designed to work with Assemble.

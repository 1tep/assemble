While Grunt.js is focused on providing powerful baseline functionality, with an emphasis on utility - as with the `grunt-lib-contrib` library, Assemble offers conventions and methodologies for applying and extending the powerful functionality offered by Grunt.js.




We created this project after seeing this too often: "Our framework will help you, but only if you do things our way."

Assemble attempts to demonstrate best practices without forcing you to use them. Inside the box you will find the following tools and technologies:

  * Sensible configuration defaults
  *

Assemble includes **collection of conventions and components for rapidly building web projects**, using **HTML and CSS components, scaffolds, client-side templates, mock-data, CSS pre-processors, markdown, YAML, JSON, sensible configuration defaults and a Grunt.js build system to make it work while you're sleeping - on the job or off, that's up to you.

## Putting the Puzzle Together
There are many client-side templating engines and few examples for how to use them in your project. This project fills that gap,



## So is Assemble a build system?
No, Assemble's _build system_ is [Grunt.js]().

We also created some custom Grunt plugins and node modules that are specifically geared towards making it more flexible for you to assemble projects. So rather than hard-coding our own custom build system into Assemble and forcing you to do everything _our way_, Assemble uses Grunt.js, which means this project merely makes suggestions but leaves the decisions up to you.

**A system is not a strategy**
Yes, that's true. The goal of this project is to show you best practices and conventions for assembling web projects out of re-usable components, but we'll leave the strategy to you.




## Who is this for?
Both designers and developers, front and backend.
